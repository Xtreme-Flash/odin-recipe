    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>Air-frying nachos is quick, easy, and finger-licking good. This is a basic recipe, so make it your own by using your favorite toppings and cheese,<br> just not so many that the nachos end up soggy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>8 ounces lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon taco seasoning</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>5 ounces thin corn tortilla chips</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer at 360 degrees F (182 degrees C) for about 5 minutes. Line the air fryer basket with foil or a parchment liner,<br> and spray with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Heat a small skillet over medium heat and cook ground beef until browned and crumbly, about 3 minutes; drain grease. Stir in water,</br> taco seasoning, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Remove skillet from heat.</li>
        <li>Set tortilla chips in the basket, spreading them out and overlapping slightly so the melted cheese won't drip through the open gaps.<br> Evenly sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the chips. Only add a couple of layers of chips with cheese in between in the fryer basket,<br> or just add a single layer and cook in batches.</li>
        <li>Evenly distribute ground beef and black beans over the cheese, sprinkle green onions on top, and add spoonfuls of salsa.</li>
        <li>Transfer the basket into the air fryer and cook until cheese is melted and starting to slightly brown on the edges, 4 to 6 minutes. <br>The nachos will cook evenly and quickly but watch closely so they don't burn.</li>
        <li>Remove nachos to a serving plate, garnish with sour cream, and serve immediately.<br> Put extra toppings in small bowls and let everybody customize their nachos.</li>
    </ol>
